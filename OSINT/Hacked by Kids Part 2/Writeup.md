# BlitzCTF 2025 â€” Hacked by Kids Part 2

Iâ€™m proud to say that this is my favorite challenge Iâ€™ve created in BlitzCTF 2025 so far.

Since itâ€™s related to **Part 1**, we need to look at the characters from the previous crime case.

## Step 1 â€” Following the Links

Heâ€™s the guy ðŸ“ˆ.  
Check every link â€” one of them leads to a YouTube video about the crime case:

## Step 2 â€” The News Clue

As the description mentions, he revealed his location on a news platform.  
Check every link and look for interesting comments or information.

On the **20 Minutes** news site, youâ€™ll find Cracka commenting on his own case:

## Step 3 â€” The Restaurant and IP Address

In the comment, he says heâ€™s sitting in a restaurant that **closes at 8:30 PM** (and heâ€™s not happy about it).  
You can also see his **IP address** in his profile picture:

Look up the IP address and find its origin:

Latitude: 52.6386 (52Â° 38â€² 18.96â€³ N)  
Longitude: -1.1317 (1Â° 7â€² 54.08â€³ W)

## Step 4 â€” Finding the Location

As mentioned in the description, go to Google Maps and locate the coordinates.

Search for restaurants nearby that close at 8:30 PM:  
https://www.google.com/maps/search/Restaurants/@52.6386,-1.1342749,694m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m7!2m6!3m5!1sRestaurants!2s52.6388,+-1.1317!4m2!1d-1.1317229!2d52.6387613?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYzMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D

The only match youâ€™ll find is:  
**PHá»ž LÃŠ Vietnamese Restaurant** â€” https://maps.app.goo.gl/gLPGanBYNYHEs2168

---

## Step 5 â€” The Flag

Check the restaurantâ€™s reviews and youâ€™ll get the flag.
