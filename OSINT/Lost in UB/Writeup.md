# BlitzCTF 2025 — Lost in UB

First of all, you have to get to know the case and list down the details you’ve discovered so far.

## Step 1 — Clues from the Conversation

I was **next to Genghis Khan National Museum, Mongolia**:  
https://maps.app.goo.gl/dqF4tG2AALnWTqQX7

They wanted me to take a bus to get back to the hotel.  
As mentioned at **12:26**, I had to hop off the bus. If you check closely, the original message was sent at **12:10** — meaning it takes **16 minutes** to reach the final destination (the station where I switched to a different trip).

He also mentioned **another trip** I posted on social media where I took the **same bus**.

Lastly, there is a **Japanese restaurant** located near the hotel.

✅ **We now have everything from the chat.** Time to stalk myself.

## Step 2 — Different Trip to National University

**Twitter/X Profile:** https://x.com/Zwique_1337

Here you’ll find posts discussing my plan to visit the **National University of Mongolia**.  
However, this is a **different trip** from the one going from the Genghis Khan National Museum to the hotel.

On my **personal blog**, I mentioned the station where I hopped on.

## Step 3 — Finding the Blog

Using **Sherlock**, you’ll discover:  
- https://zwique.blogspot.com/ (text-only blog)  
- https://github.com/Zwique/  

On my GitHub, you’ll find my **image blog**:

## Step 4 — Bus Line Evidence

The blog clearly shows images of me taking the **Ч:28** bus line and heading to a certain station.

Google Maps confirms:  
https://www.google.com/maps/dir/47.9228543,106.9147054/МУБИС,+SBD+-+8+khoroo,+Ulaanbaatar/@47.9210604,106.9144673,2274m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x5d96924746339b05:0x63195dbfccabd5df!2m2!1d106.923851!2d47.9185715!3e3

- Bus line **Ч:28** stops at **MUBIS Station**.  
- It takes **16 minutes** to reach the station from Genghis Khan National Museum.

## Step 6 — Locating the Exact Spot

This part can be tricky.  
It’s possible to locate it by virtually exploring around MUBIS Station on Google Maps:
