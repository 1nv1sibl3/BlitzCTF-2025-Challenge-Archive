## Description

A young group hacked an officer’s security—not for money, but to embarrass powerful people by leaking private messages and files. It started as a daring stunt, but a small mistake gave them away. Their plan didn’t last long, and they were soon caught.

Your mission is to investigate the case, uncover the Criminal/Case No, and format it as a flag.
