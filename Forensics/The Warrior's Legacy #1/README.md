## Description

A legendary warrior's equipment set has been recovered from an ancient dungeon. The complete set includes enchanted weapons, armor, and various tools that served the warrior well in countless battles.

Local legends speak of a hidden message that the warrior split across their most prized possessions before disappearing into the depths. The equipment appears to be standard enchanted gear, but those who know where to look claim there's more than meets the eye.

Your task: Examine the warrior's complete equipment set and piece together the secret they left behind.
