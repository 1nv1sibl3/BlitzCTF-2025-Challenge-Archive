## Description

The flag? Gone.
Where is it? Rumor says some BlitzCTF authors broke it into pieces and… let’s just say they’re keeping it safely.

You’ll need to track them down and put the pieces back together.

Here's a little poetic wisdom to guide you:

🧠 “The silent one hides, the watcher stalks, the sly one snickers, the quick one drops, the rebel strikes, the phantom lingers, and the last one laughs.”

Piece it all together! Good luck cracking the puzzle 😉

P.S - wrap the words in correct order separated with _ in the Blitz{ }
