The name and GitHub compare hints towards the **diff** tool in Linux. Reading other writeups some even used XOR to solve it which basically works in the same way only.

To solve we have to take diff of the strings of both the images. Running the following commands:

```bash
strings -n 1 img1.jpg > 1.txt
strings -n 1 img2.jpg > 2.txt
diff img1.jpg img2.jpg

Output:
3d2
< Qmx
8c7
< )
---
> pdHp7)
10c9
< ZDFm
---
> Rl8x
77d75
< U1
949a948
>       91N
4707d4705
< TNm
4770a4769
> dUx9
```

By reconstructing the base64 payload from the output we get `QmxpdHp7ZDFmRl8xU191NTNmdUx9` which decodes and gives us the flag as:

```
Blitz{d1fF_1S_u53fuL}
```
