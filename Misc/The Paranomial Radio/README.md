## Description

Our paranormal investigation team has been monitoring this abandoned radio station 
for weeks. The old equipment keeps broadcasting strange transmissions mixed with 
eerie music. We've managed to tap into their main frequency, but the signal seems 
to be coming from... somewhere else.

Local ham radio operators report hearing weird digital sounds between the spooky 
tracks. Some say it sounds like old-school data transmission... but who's sending 
data from a haunted radio station?

Maybe the spirits are trying to communicate through more than just EVPs this time...

The investigation team has provided access to their monitoring system. 
Find the transmission source and decode what the spirits are trying to tell us.
